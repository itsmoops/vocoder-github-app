# Business Philosophy

## Serve Solo Devs and Small Teams

- Optimize for speed and clarity — these users do not have time to read dense docs or deal with enterprise overhead.
- Pricing must be transparent and affordable, with generous free tiers.

## Not Built to be a Unicorn

- This is not a VC-fueled rocketship; it is a sustainable, product-focused business.
- We care more about customer satisfaction than ARR growth charts.

## Open by Default

- Source code for core SDKs should be public.
- Prioritize integrations with other open tools — avoid vendor lock-in.

## Ethical AI

- Translation should respect context, privacy, and user intent.
- No user-submitted data should be used to train models without explicit consent.# Business Philosophy
