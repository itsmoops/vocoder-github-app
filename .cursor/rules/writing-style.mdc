# Writing Style Guide

## Voice

- Friendly but not overly casual
- Clear, direct, and confident
- No jargon or filler — get to the point
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness

## Tone

- Professional but developer-friendly
- Supportive and encouraging
- Never salesy — explain value, don’t hype

## Documentation

- Use present tense and active voice
- Code comes first — explain with examples
- Prefer bullets and short paragraphs

## CLI Output / Logs

- Use clear, lowercase instructions:
  - ✅ good: `uploading source strings...`
  - 🚫 bad: `Now beginning process to Upload Source Files...`
- Include helpful tips when things go wrong

## Onboarding / UI Copy

- Assume the user is smart and busy
- “You” is preferred over passive phrasing
- Use verbs:
  - `Add a source file`
  - `Connect your repo`
  - `Choose your base language`
