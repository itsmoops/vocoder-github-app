# Branding Guidelines

## Name

- The product is called **Vocoder** — evokes retro synths, audio clarity, and "voice".
- The tone should blend analog nostalgia with modern utility.

## Typography

- If feasible, use open-source geometric sans-serif fonts inspired by synth branding (e.g., Inter, Space Grotesk).
- Typography should be clean, modern, and legible — never overly decorative.

## Visual Style

- Blend vintage synthesizer aesthetics (colors, knobs, layouts) with modern UI design.
- Avoid sterile tech visuals; favor warmth, vibrancy, and human touch.

## Voice and Tone

- Use friendly, confident, developer-savvy language.
- Be concise but expressive — avoid jargon unless it helps the user.
- Use analogies from audio and synth culture to make concepts resonate.

## Logo

- The logo should suggest modularity, signal flow, or audio waveforms.
- Circular, waveform, or patch cable motifs are encouraged.# Branding Guidelines
